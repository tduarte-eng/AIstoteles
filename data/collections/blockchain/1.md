ERC-20
======

An ERC-20 token contract keeps track of [_fungible_ tokens](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/tokens#different-kinds-of-tokens)
: any one token is exactly equal to any other token; no tokens have special rights or behavior associated with them. This makes ERC-20 tokens useful for things like a **medium of exchange currency**, **voting rights**, **staking**, and more.

OpenZeppelin Contracts provides many ERC20-related contracts. On the [`API reference`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/token/ERC20)
 you’ll find detailed information on their properties and usage.

Constructing an ERC-20 Token Contract
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using Contracts, we can easily create our own ERC-20 token contract, which will be used to track _Gold_ (GLD), an internal currency in a hypothetical game.

Here’s what our GLD token might look like.

    // contracts/GLDToken.sol
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    pragma solidity ^0.8.20;
    
    import {ERC20} from "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
    
    contract GLDToken is ERC20 {
        constructor(uint256 initialSupply) ERC20("Gold", "GLD") {
            _mint(msg.sender, initialSupply);
        }
    }

Our contracts are often used via [inheritance](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contracts.html#inheritance)
, and here we’re reusing [`ERC20`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/token/ERC20#erc20)
 for both the basic standard implementation and the [`name`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/token/ERC20#ERC20-name--)
, [`symbol`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/token/ERC20#ERC20-symbol--)
, and [`decimals`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/token/ERC20#ERC20-decimals--)
 optional extensions. Additionally, we’re creating an `initialSupply` of tokens, which will be assigned to the address that deploys the contract.

That’s it! Once deployed, we will be able to query the deployer’s balance:

    > GLDToken.balanceOf(deployerAddress)
    1000000000000000000000

We can also [transfer](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/token/ERC20#IERC20-transfer-address-uint256-)
 these tokens to other accounts:

    > GLDToken.transfer(otherAddress, 300000000000000000000)
    > GLDToken.balanceOf(otherAddress)
    300000000000000000000
    > GLDToken.balanceOf(deployerAddress)
    700000000000000000000

A Note on `decimals`
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Often, you’ll want to be able to divide your tokens into arbitrary amounts: say, if you own `5 GLD`, you may want to send `1.5 GLD` to a friend, and keep `3.5 GLD` to yourself. Unfortunately, Solidity and the EVM do not support this behavior: only integer (whole) numbers can be used, which poses an issue. You may send `1` or `2` tokens, but not `1.5`.

To work around this, [`ERC20`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/token/ERC20#ERC20)
 provides a [`decimals`](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/api/token/ERC20#ERC20-decimals--)
 field, which is used to specify how many decimal places a token has. To be able to transfer `1.5 GLD`, `decimals` must be at least `1`, since that number has a single decimal place.

How can this be achieved? It’s actually very simple: a token contract can use larger integer values, so that a balance of `50` will represent `5 GLD`, a transfer of `15` will correspond to `1.5 GLD` being sent, and so on.

It is important to understand that `decimals` is _only used for display purposes_. All arithmetic inside the contract is still performed on integers, and it is the different user interfaces (wallets, exchanges, etc.) that must adjust the displayed values according to `decimals`. The total token supply and balance of each account are not specified in `GLD`: you need to divide by `10 ** decimals` to get the actual `GLD` amount.

You’ll probably want to use a `decimals` value of `18`, just like Ether and most ERC-20 token contracts in use, unless you have a very special reason not to. When minting tokens or transferring them around, you will be actually sending the number `num GLD * (10 ** decimals)`.

|     |     |
| --- | --- |
|     | By default, `ERC20` uses a value of `18` for `decimals`. To use a different value, you will need to override the `decimals()` function in your contract. |

    function decimals() public view virtual override returns (uint8) {
      return 16;
    }

So if you want to send `5` tokens using a token contract with 18 decimals, the method to call will actually be:

    transfer(recipient, 5 * (10 ** 18));
